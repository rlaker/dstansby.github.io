I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [solar](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl/research/solar-system/solar-physics) and [space plasma](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl/research/solar-system/space-plasma-physics) physics groups at the [Mullard Space Science Laboratory](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl/). My research is focused on
linking in-situ measurements of the solar wind with remote sensing observations of the Sun to learn
about processes that create, heat, and accelerate the solar wind.
