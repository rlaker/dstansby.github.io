I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [solar](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl/research/solar-system/solar-physics)
and [space plasma](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl/research/solar-system/space-plasma-physics)
physics groups at the [Mullard Space Science Laboratory](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl/).

My research
-----------
I am primarily interested in  linking in-situ measurements of the solar wind
with remote sensing observations of the Sun to learn about processes that
create, heat, and accelerate the solar wind.
